FALSE,FALSE,"JamesNesbitt thedailybeast The point is, no one has the right to kill/silence you for being offensive unless they win a fair lawsuit."
FALSE,FALSE,JamesNesbitt thedailybeast But the entire point of satire IS being provocative. Banning 'offensiveness' is banning free speech.Gotta go.

FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry considering they are the ones who drew the pictures, you are right. They do appreciate it."
FALSE,FALSE,MaxD stephenfry I'm sure their grieving friends and families are comforted. #Pointless
FALSE,FALSE,"stephenfry given one the police officers murdered was a muslim, should cartoons that could offend his family be reposted?"
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage MaxD stephenfry And you acting like a holier than thou douchebag is helping so much? Get real. STFU.
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage MaxD stephenfry you're kidding, right? These guys lived to make  comics  continuing their work is what they would want."
FALSE,FALSE,BaKaiyaTeru MaxD stephenfry Really intelligent comeback there. Well done è
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry  it shows how feeble some folks are. Getting offended over a cartoon and then killing for it.  that is insane
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore MaxD stephenfry 'comics'?? Really? They intentionally set out to cause offence and the French govt explicitly advised them
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry biggest insult to their memory would be to concede to fear as the terrorists want. Spread the pix to honor them
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore MaxD stephenfry on numerous occasions not to do it. None of which condones in the slightest what the terrorists did tho
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry doesn't show dead people anything. Shows terrorists that they won't silence ideas. Shows solidarity w/ survivors.
FALSE,FALSE,Greyhound stephenfry I totally agree.
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage MaxD stephenfry so you're saying it's okay that terrorists killed  people because they disagreed with free speech?
FALSE,FALSE,"MaxD stephenfry But in the process, continuing to offend Muslims. I agree with this view http//t.co/WI"

FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore MaxD stephenfry It's your choice to take offence. Make better choices.

FALSE,FALSE,"tomwigmore if you read the second part of my tweet, you'll see I in no way condone that and it's horrific."
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry It sounds like you are happy they were shut up. People who kill over a cartoon are the problem, not the cartoon."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry so what. No one has the right to be protected from being offended. Charlie Hebdo also satirised Jews amp Christians
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage but you are saying we roll over and allow the terrorists the freedom to kill, as free expression should be repressed, no?"
FALSE,FALSE,"tomwigmore kirstym MaxD stephenfry Agreed and no sane person would say otherwise but that's the point, the terrorists aren't"
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry the answer is more speech. Speak out, speak out against terrorists who hijack your religion."
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage kirstym MaxD stephenfry but you're still missing the fact that if we hide the posts, the terrorists win."
FALSE,FALSE,BaKaiyaTeru stephenfry it 'sounds' like I'm happy?? What planet are you on. You sound like George Bush 'with us or against them'
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry offend them more. Offend Christians, atheists, Jews, Asians. Makes no difference.Who cares that they're offended?"
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry you can't say a religion is a religion of peace and love and then threaten to kill those who insult it.
FALSE,FALSE,MJIBrown stephenfry That question is offensive bro.
FALSE,FALSE,docslacker stephenfry Did they have a special edition satirising Christians and Jews? They intentionally targeted Islam to get publicity
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry You keep blaming the victim, maybe you want to look into that first."
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore no. Everyone should and has free speech but most people use that responsibly. I have the right to shout Fire but don't do so
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore kirstym stephenfry what if I'm offended that women are allowed to speak out of turn?
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage docslacker stephenfry Yes.

Next question, or are you just going to keep being an ignorant apologist?"
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore on a crowded train or theatre. What did they gain by doing this when no other publications did?
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage take  minutes to google Charlie covers. Their take on the Christian trinity and homophobia is pretty harsh.
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage you're missing the point of satire. It's supposed to be borderline comedy. Those who take it otherwise need thicker skins.
FALSE,FALSE,docslacker stephenfry You mean like all the major Muslim nations have? http//t.co/EfTEsokdbX
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore they set out to make a point. They did.
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore kirstym MaxD stephenfry Win what? And what do we gain?
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage their covers lampooning Catholic Church hypocrisy, the inability to criticise jewish extremism, etc..."
FALSE,FALSE,MaxD stephenfry what do we gain other than offending mainstream people?
FALSE,FALSE,"tomwigmore totalkharnage MaxD stephenfry Fuck you islam, fuck you christian, fuck you invisible friend illness spreader."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore kirstym stephenfry they want to instill fear.To dictate our lives. Silencing free speech is surrender
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage by saying something no one else would. They spoke out and continued through oppression. And now the world looks on agreeing
FALSE,FALSE,"BaKaiyaTeru stephenfry I do think they were incredibly stupid but again, nothing justifies terrorism. Nothing."
FALSE,FALSE,MaxD tomwigmore kirstym stephenfry Feel free to be offended and I defend your right to feel such way and speak out about it.
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry That they were ""stupid"" is irrelevant and an insult to them. Maybe they were just braver than you."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage and I am glad and hopeful Arab and Muslim leaders are speaking out. It is a turning point. I want to support moderates.
FALSE,FALSE,BaKaiyaTeru docslacker stephenfry  apologist for what? Just because I disagree with the cartoons makes me an  apologist for terrorists?
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage MaxD kirstym stephenfry don't the cartoonists have the right to speak out about religions then?
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore Not sure ending up dead and being firebombed is worth the laughs but that's a decision every person makes themselves.
FALSE,FALSE,MaxD tomwigmore Which is?
FALSE,FALSE,"BonnettJosh stephenfry not a rhetorical question. I care about freedom of speech amp the policeman's family, so the issue troubles me."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry why should there be another objective? Offense can be their objective and still be valid.
FALSE,FALSE,"RaAmarr tomwigmore MaxD stephenfry Again, intelligent comeback. Well done."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage BaKaiyaTeru disagree with the cartoons. But what can you expect when you criticise people for refusing to be silenced?
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore they published hundreds of comics. I'm sure you're savvy enough to extrapolate some meaning from a few.
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage MaxD ""fuck you, oppression""."
FALSE,FALSE,"BonnettJosh stephenfry people should be free to repost the offending cartoons, but is this a reasonable thing to do?"
FALSE,FALSE,"tomwigmore And what were they saying other than causing offence, intentionally?"
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage Death is the extreme. But these cartoonists stood for what they believed in the face of adversity. That's admirable.
FALSE,FALSE,BaKaiyaTeru stephenfry 'Braver'. One mans bravery is another mans stupidity. Idolising them now they're dead is easy to do.
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage tomwigmore MaxD stephenfry Awww. Are you offended? Are you slam? You must be. I have two words, can u figure them out"
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage It's SATIRE. Would you have this much angst against The Onion? They had messages to say, and they told them."
FALSE,FALSE,MaxD stephenfry And I reserve the right to be offended and to speak up. Why is that difficult to understand? Not advocating violence tho
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage tomwigmore And here, in a quiet corner of Twitter, is the problem entirely."
FALSE,FALSE,MaxD tomwigmore Help me because I fail to understand it.
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage docslacker stephenfry tough tatties if people take offence, it's satire. That's the point. No need to look if it's annoying"
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage MaxD tomwigmore kirstym stephenfry the whole world is offended by what happened the offensive part was death.
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore Are firebombs and bullets are a worthy response to satire? Are you actually implying people should be silent?
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore Oh give me a break. Just mindless platitudes that are used in the papers and news to make them look like heroes. Total tripe
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry you are saying we should censor the images or at least their spread, because it is offensive. That is the issue"
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore Why is it difficult for you to understand that I don't have to agree with everything the Lord stephenfry says? Move on.
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore you do know us lot in Europe have been brought up with the ideal of free speech? Its our right
FALSE,FALSE,StanleyBurgoyne tomwigmore What's the problem with disagreeing with someones point of view and why are you so offended by that?
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage MaxD stephenfry You should be more offended by those who use your religion to firebomb and kill.
FALSE,FALSE,"totalkharnage stephenfry I'm not saying agree with Stephen Fry, at all. I'm saying realise that you're apologising for terrorists."
FALSE,FALSE,"Boulton docslacker stephenfry Agreed. I take offence but I'm not about to commit murder. People disagree, it's a democracy. Move on."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore a few points I can see religions are hypocritical. Politicians at least some are corrupt. Etc. multiple.duh?
FALSE,FALSE,"solastary tomwigmore No amp no. You can disagree, be offended and not advocate violence. A distinction that some on Twitter find difficult"
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage I will defend your right to belief what you want. I will stand against those who want to impose their beliefs on others.
FALSE,FALSE,"MaxD stephenfry Again, do not see what is gained in the slightest from this at all. Why have many publications not published them?"
FALSE,FALSE,"Themightydodgy tomwigmore I was born amp bred in the UK so when you say 'us lot in Europe', I'm one of you. Stop being offensive."
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage stephenfry no one is forcing them to publish anything. You are either trolling or quite illogical in this it seems.
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore well get on the same page then.
FALSE,FALSE,"solastary MaxD stephenfry And why can't I be both? It's not a zero sum game. Again, you can be against both although I place murder"
FALSE,FALSE,"solastary MaxD stephenfry much higher up the list than publishing some stupid, thoughtless cartoons."
FALSE,FALSE,tomwigmore stephenfry Oh dear god. So thinking the cartoons are stupid is apologising for terrorists? There goes any logical argument.
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage tomwigmore . Then go out there and teach your young men what is a worthy response. Teach them that firebombs...

FALSE,FALSE,"Themightydodgy tomwigmore Why should I?? So because I disagree with your point of view, I'm not 'one of you'?? We live in a democracy"
FALSE,FALSE,totalkharnage MaxD stephenfry If you are go out there and do something about it. Start reaching out to those angry young men.

FALSE,FALSE,janetravers I'll don't have time to fully flesh out my position now. My basic point would be that one can defend freedom of speech ...
FALSE,FALSE,"janetravers ... w/o celebrating speech that is problematic. Many Charlie cartoons fail into that category, IMO."

FALSE,FALSE,zipida wikileaks Yup.
FALSE,FALSE,duncanbrown wikileaks I know well and it's disgusting. But one thing is not being discriminatory a priori against Muslims. Another...
FALSE,FALSE,devicerandom if it had been child pornographers that had been murdered we wouldn't be upholding their freedom of expression would we?

FALSE,FALSE,"duncanbrown wikileaks I know it's a delicate line, no one denies that. But it's necessary. IMHO religion deserves no intellectual respect"

FALSE,FALSE,"duncanbrown They defended religious freedom. Including the freedom of being antireligious openly and harshly. Again, please check."
FALSE,FALSE,duncanbrown Defending freedom of religion is not the same as endorsing religion or holding it as sacred.
FALSE,FALSE,"devicerandom Freedom of anything is not a physical entity/law, it's a privilege. Hence not absolute."
FALSE,FALSE,"zipida My point is logical. Freedom of opinion requires, *by definition*, its absoluteness. Otherwise you are no more free."
FALSE,FALSE,devicerandom saying Islam is a terrorist religion is not defending freedom of speech
FALSE,FALSE,"devicerandom No it doesn't. And no you're not ""free"" at least in physiological sense."
FALSE,FALSE,"duncanbrown Well, people should be free to say it and I to disagree harshly."

TRUE,FALSE,SportsPolitic piersmorgan That's hilarious. This type of thing happens once every  years in France. Twice a year in the USA
TRUE,FALSE,FletchButcher piersmorgan nothing hilarious about people getting killed. You are a disgrace.
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues ljnicholls piersmorgan seriously ?? U r gonna jump on a single exception ??
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab piersmorgan Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts"
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues piersmorgan by whom ?? The government or the media and the people
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab piersmorgan Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism"
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues piersmorgan i dont care about the govt  The federal govt acknowledged that only % of attacks were carried out by muslims
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues piersmorgan the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues piersmorgan however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab piersmorgan That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues piersmorgan and i think this only started after  ... Not after mcveigh  And that the media is to blame 
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab piersmorgan  Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence That's STUPID
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues piersmorgan but the majority  Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this 
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab piersmorgan After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ??
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab piersmorgan Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but  final straw"
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues and millions of them condemning such violence 
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues how about we work the other way around two
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil  Lets consider the foreign invasions  Irak afghanistan ...
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it?
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues the invasion of irak or afghanistan  But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military 
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words 
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion 
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims  And consequently so are western people
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ?
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly 
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab That's funny They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in coldblood at schools
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues not only at schools  There are loads of examples  The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed  in a youth camp
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence?
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues and not only muslims
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings"
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues not millions  These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives 
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it 
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists  And they r few compared
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me  Or do you think i am a terrorist ??
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab Actually, I would NEVER agree with that They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel"
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues i am just happy we agree on the same concepts  Perhaps i am too pessimistic But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear"
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us muslims trying to improve
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an ""infidel"""
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me  Either way my response is the same
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too"
TRUE,FALSE,mostafaihab We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better.
TRUE,FALSE,acbvalues its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression  Perhaps it was a misinterpretation
TRUE,FALSE,"mostafaihab I do know that there are peaceful Muslims, but not sure if Islam is a religion of peace. None of history shows that to be."

TRUE,FALSE,"StDxCorrosive that's a verse, yes. What exactly is your point? I will have fun proving your ignorance"
TRUE,FALSE,"HAz My point, is you can't say a blatant verse stating to ""kill them wherever you find them"" US, EU, ME is taken out of context..."
TRUE,FALSE,StDxCorrosive yes I can because you still don't understand judging by how you still take things out of context. http//t.co/vbTSJRds
TRUE,FALSE,StDxCorrosive read the article. I'm pretty sure you'll still be ignorant even when you see the truth but I guess thats not my problem

TRUE,FALSE,"HAz StDxCorrosive opinion on the subject. By all means, block me account so you don't have to see it."
TRUE,FALSE,"StDxCorrosive your opinion is fine, the ignorance not so much. If you read the article you'd understand the context and why it was said"
TRUE,FALSE,"HAz StDxCorrosive So he replaces the word ""them"" with ""idolaters"" and that makes it okay? Yes the bible said kill idolaters but"
TRUE,FALSE,HAz StDxCorrosive only he without sin can cast the first stone.
TRUE,FALSE,HAz StDxCorrosive and I'm pretty sure it wasn't God who said that it was man.
TRUE,FALSE,StDxCorrosive you still havent caught on. At the time Muhammed and followers were being tortured and constantly attacked.
TRUE,FALSE,"StDxCorrosive defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, wouldnt you agree?"
TRUE,FALSE,StDxCorrosive Said what?
TRUE,FALSE,HAz StDxCorrosive That idolaters should be stone.
TRUE,FALSE,HAz they may loathe gays but at least they don't hang them.Your point is invalid
TRUE,FALSE,"lemonscrolls you said that I believe gays should be hung, I said I don't? How is my point invalid?"
TRUE,FALSE,HAz don't deny the truth go to any Islamic country and say you're gay and they will kill you
TRUE,FALSE,StDxCorrosive you aren't answering my replies that disprove yours and now you're changing the topic to stoning?
TRUE,FALSE,"HAz StDxCorrosive No, I'm sorry I only saw the other reply. I'll go back and read the other replies."
TRUE,FALSE,HAz StDxCorrosive Defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different.
TRUE,FALSE,"HAz StDxCorrosive War could be justified then, but when they set off bombs at a marathon or kill reporters in Paris its uncalled for."
TRUE,FALSE,lemonscrolls it is forbidden in the Quran to be gay. It is forbidden in the bible too and punishment for it there is also death.
TRUE,FALSE,"StDxCorrosive Yes you're right, the US government and extremists do do this often. As well as the jews in Israel killing palestinians"
TRUE,FALSE,HAz the difference is Christians don't actually do it
TRUE,FALSE,"StDxCorrosive we dont know if boston marathon was a hoax by government and in both it was a case of extremists, not true followers of islam"
TRUE,FALSE,"lemonscrolls Yes, apparently they don't follow what God wants them to do, the God they claim is all knowing"
TRUE,FALSE,HAz exactly because they realise that it is stupid
TRUE,FALSE,lemonscrolls if you choose to believe in God/a religion you cannot just hand pick what of it you want to believe in
