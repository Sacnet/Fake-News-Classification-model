TRUE,TRUE,The gunman in Ottawa has been shot and killed. I'm at a loss for words this morning. That isn't my Canada.
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford Oh Canada.
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford agreed
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford what's your source? That's not confirmed!
TRUE,FALSE,"kellyoxford Was it your Canada when that guy beheaded that other guy on the bus? Shit happens, but we're mostly still fine up here"
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford the gunman is still on the loose.
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford please wait on this. Also sounds like multiple suspects. People need to stay vigilant.
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford might want to actually confirm shit like that before tweeting.
TRUE,FALSE,"obiterdictayo I know what I'm doing here, thanks."
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford It's Harper's Canada though
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford obiterdictayo there has been zero confirmation that gunman is down. Maybe let news outlets on scene handle the reporting.
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford my thoughts also
TRUE,FALSE,alcanlin kellyoxford great response bro.
TRUE,FALSE,HDMcC kellyoxford obiterdictayo why shouldn't a private citizen make a comment on a news event?
TRUE,FALSE,TwitchieRich kellyoxford I try. Unfortunately I donôt think itôd protect me against bullets
TRUE,FALSE,subloke kellyoxford obiterdictayo Not a comment. Stated  gunman had been neutralized.Simply not true. Over k followers.Irresponsible.
TRUE,FALSE,HDMcC kellyoxford obiterdictayo the news report I'm watching currently reported the same thing before Kelly tweeted it.
TRUE,FALSE,HDMcC kellyoxford obiterdictayo CBC news is reporting the gunman has been shot. Are you bitching at them also?
TRUE,FALSE,subloke kellyoxford obiterdictayo Stated as fact before news outlets even suggested.Still uncertain.Leave news to news pros.Done here.
TRUE,FALSE,subloke HDMcC kellyoxford obiterdictayo they confirm facts before 'reporting'.
TRUE,FALSE,HDMcC maybe people shouldn't look to the tweets of comedy writers for their news facts?
TRUE,FALSE,subloke HDMcC I had confirmed the first gunman was dead when I tweeted.

TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford subloke you managed to confirm before any other news outlet in Canada. Bravo.
TRUE,FALSE,"HDMcC kellyoxford where's the ""sigh I give up"" emoticon? Do you not understand twitter?"
TRUE,FALSE,HDMcC subloke I can get confirmation and video from witnesses and pass info along without a news producer. Simple stuff.
TRUE,FALSE,kellyoxford HDMcC maybe you should have a news crew on retainer just in case. Rapid deploy anywhere breaking news happens.
TRUE,FALSE,"HDMcC kellyoxford exactly, because they are ""journalists"" and ""dems the rules"" Kelly is a ""comedic writer"" no rules. Go police journalists"
TRUE,FALSE,daxshepard HDMcC THANK YOU.
TRUE,FALSE,HDMcC kellyoxford subloke Perhaps all of Twitter should follow HDM so we can learn the proper ways of Tweeting responsibly.
