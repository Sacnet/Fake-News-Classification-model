FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC not a religion of peace at all - read this to know about true Islam http//t.co/wrZoGzTT
FALSE,FALSE,"Ssulemaan CNBC The Koran talking about unbelievers -  ""Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"""
FALSE,FALSE,CNBC Yes...wait until they find out the bullets that killed the hostages came from police. #sydneysiege
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Read the Holy Quran tell me the verse... Islam doesn't allow to kill any innocent from any religion...
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Islam says that we should obey other religions and impress them with our good deeds.Unfortunately that isn't happening.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC These people portrait them as Muslim but they are Anti-Islamic. They don't belong to Islam.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC If u saw the news today + died in Pakistan % Muslim country. I think u would have got something in your mind now..
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC this is useless stuff...
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC This link is filled with verses from the Quran.  Can you read? http//t.co/wrZoGzTT
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC Explain to me what Quran  means
FALSE,FALSE,"Ssulemaan CNBC You say ""this is useless stuff"".  It's the Quran   You don't know your own holy book "
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Read the Surat Al-Anfal from  from the beginning translatedand if you understand English.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC it Clearly says that if the disbelievers are advancing towards you than you should not turn your back. Advancing ok.dear
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC just reading a blog and or anti-religious pages doesn't gives you knowledge about Islam.
FALSE,FALSE,"Ssulemaan CNBC So, you don't believe the Quran? because that's what it is - the QURAN!!"
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC Your statements show you know less about your Islam religion than I do.  You don't even know the words of the Quran!!
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC I haven't stated anything I said you to read. You can not understand this how will you understand The Holy Quran.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Alhumdulillah I believe in Holy Quran. And don't follow some random pages.
FALSE,FALSE,"Ssulemaan CNBC Another question to you - why do your mosques give money to the killer ""radicals"" if they are against them?"
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC It says to kill the infidels.  Kill all the unbelievers of Islam.  That's what the true followers are doing.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC I said killing of innocent people is forbidden in Islam. If someone is funding to do that he is against it.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC you realy don't know English or you still going to random page. Try to read the Holy Quran.  Not the internet.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC if you don't believe anything don't criticize it until you don't know about it.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Islam has more than a billion followers and a bunch of criminals cannot are doing this.
FALSE,FALSE,"Ssulemaan CNBC It's like the US military.  I'm not in it, but I support it.  Those billions of Muslims are supporting those ""criminals""."
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC your are an idiot. Do you know the population of earth. One billion will support killing you would have been dead by now

FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Come up with solid points. Or leave.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC think as you like. But whenever I will find anyone saying anything wrong about my religion I will prove it wrong.
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC i already showed you where your holy Quran told you to behead people who don't believe.  You're too blind to see it.
FALSE,FALSE,"Ssulemaan CNBC In other words, you liked Bin Laden and the others who the US Army stopped.  You LOVE their murders, because it's the Quran"
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC And I told you read from the beginning 
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC I did read it from the beginning.  It still said the same thing - BEHEAD the unbelievers!!!
FALSE,FALSE,Ssulemaan CNBC I read it all here http//t.co/TlWVnNXN  It's an EVIL book.
FALSE,FALSE,BubbleLad CNBC Usama was more loyal to US.He fought for US in Afghanistan against USSR.and after that he gave reasons to USA to invade.
